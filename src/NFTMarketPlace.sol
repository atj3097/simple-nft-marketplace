Sellers can sell() their NFT while specifying a price and expiration. Instead of
depositing the NFT into the contract, they give the contract approval to withdraw
it from them. If a buyer comes along and pays the specified price before the
expiration, then the NFT is transferred from the seller to the buyer and the
buyerâ€™s ether is transferred to the seller.

The seller can cancel() the sale at any time.

Corner cases:

What if the seller lists the same NFT twice? This can theoretically happen since
they don't transfer the NFT to the marketplace.
