## Simple NFT Marketplace

Sellers can sell() their NFT while specifying a price and expiration. Instead of depositing the NFT into the contract, they give the contract approval to withdraw it from them. If a buyer comes along and pays the specified price before the expiration, then the NFT is transferred from the seller to the buyer and the buyerâ€™s ether is transferred to the seller.

The seller can cancel() the sale at any time.

Corner cases:

What if the seller lists the same NFT twice? This can theoretically happen since they don't transfer the NFT to the marketplace

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
